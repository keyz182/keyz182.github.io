Everyone loves Stephen Fry. His way with words, and they way that everything he says, well, you just believe it. It seems that GNU (GNU is Not Unix) has picked up on that, and have wrangled him in for some free software promotion! So for GNUs 25th birthday, Mr Fry made <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fry/happy-birthday-to-gnu.html">this</a> video, which, as his popular television show QI stands for, is quite interesting. So go, watch and most importantly, learn!
