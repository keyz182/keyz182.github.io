Woo! Visual Studio and the existing code cut me some slack today. I finally managed to properly turn the library code into a visual studio 2008 project, without something breaking, and then using said project + library in another project (again, without breaking anything). Not just that, most of the unnecessary code has been cleared away, and I have a clear(ish) idea of what needs to be done. The WiiMote seems to be working ok, though a bit jumpy, and the sensor bar is doing something to the values from the WiiMote, I just need to read the WiiYourself library docs...
