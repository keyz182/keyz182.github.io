Hi all,

I appear to be in a bit of a quandary, and I'd like your help.

&nbsp;

My job, as you may know, is that of a software developer / systems administrator / hardware device <a title="Hacker" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(hobbyist)" target="_blank">hacker</a>. The bulk of my work involves programming things, be it websites/services, dealing with hardware, connecting various services together and so on. I'm in the both fortunate position of the things I do for a living being my hobby.

This also poses a problem. You see, I'm not the most creative of people. At least, my creativity lies in the solving of problems, or the realization of ideas, rather than the discovery of problems, and the coming up with ideas. So because of this, I tend to bring over the problems and ideas I'm working on in my job(s) to my hobbies and non work time, and so I have no real escape from work.

This is where you come in. I need ideas. I need problems to solve. They can be "you should do x, that'd be cool", they can be "I have this problem, can you solve it for me?" or anything in between (or outside)! If I'm solving a problem for you, I'll ask only for some recompense for extra parts I may need to buy. Any and all problems and ideas I work on, I'll try to document fully here on this Blog. With big pretty pictures!

&nbsp;

So, what kind of ideas I hear you ask?

Well, here's a list of stuff to give you an idea:

&nbsp;

I've mounted an LCD display on my desktop that displays various bits and bobs of information that I don't ever look at, and wrote/modified some command translation code (see <a title="here" href="http://kdevans.co.uk/?p=19">here</a>).

I've got lots of electronics kit, Arduinos, Atmel AVR chips, PIC 18fs, boxes of components, boxes of computer components (cpus, mobos, drives etc) and a Chronos programmable watch.

I've got Windows, Mac and Linux OSes at my disposal.

So, guys, ideas?
